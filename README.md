# LittleReader 📚✨
*A gamified Mongolian language learning app for kids*

## Overview
LittleReader helps children learn the Mongolian language step by step — from letters to words and beyond.  
Kids see a picture, hear the word (via Chimege TTS), and try to say it aloud. AI checks their pronunciation, while fun mini-games and progress tracking keep them motivated.  

## Features
- 🎮 **Learning Games**
  - *Word Finder*: Pick the correct letters from a shuffled grid.  
  - *Drag & Drop Builder*: Arrange letters to form the word.  
- 🗣️ **Speech Recognition**: AI verifies if the child pronounced the word correctly.  
- 🗺️ **Roadmap**: Visual progression from letters → words → levels.  
- 🏆 **Profile Tracking**: Achievements, trophies, streaks, and total study time.  
- 👨‍👩‍👧 **Parent Monitoring**: Parents can review progress.
